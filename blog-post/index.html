<h1>What are design sprints? Who do they benefit and how?</h1>
  <p>Design sprints are a framework for teams of any size to solve and test design problems in 2-5 days. Working together with companies in a sprint, we shortcut the usual endless-debate cycle and compress months of time into a single week. Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, teams get great data from a prototype. The sprint gives these companies a superpower: The ability to build and test nearly any idea in just 40 hours.</p>
