	<h4>About Project</h4>
	<p>For this project, I had to get very familiar with Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in order to build a user-friendly map of the area. Within the map I had to establish two routes that a user could take (quick route and lengthy route) and point out notable places within the area.</p>
