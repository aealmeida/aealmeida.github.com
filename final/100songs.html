	<h4>About Project</h4>
	<p>For this project, I kept a record of the last 100 songs that I listened to and categorized them in seven different ways. With that data, I created a poster listing all of the songs and the categories they fell into. By the end of the project I was able to actually see my current music taste right in front of me.</p>
