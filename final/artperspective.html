	<h4>About Project</h4>
	<p>Imagine Boston 2030 is an awareness campaign that raises awarness to specific issues within Boston and how we can improve them for the future. I had to create two posters that worked both together and separately and raised awareness to one of these Boston issues. The issue I focused on is the relationship between art and graffitti in Boston.</p>
	<p>Graffiti is often given a bad rep, but Boston actually has a vast amount of beautiful street art and graffitti. We know that Boston is known for its multiple art museums and galleries, but I feel that those arent the only places to appreciate art in this busy city.</p>
