	<h4>About Project</h4>
	<p>For this project I was supposed to design a logo for the Kasita company. Kasita is a rectangular, micro-apartment housing scheme that slots in and out of metal apartment frames and fits on a moving truck bed for easy transport.</p>
	<p>Along with the logo, I had to produce a small process booklet on how I came up with my final logo. (This is just a class project and was not actually mean't to be submitted to the Kasita company.)</p>
